I fed some asvab questions into chatGPT 3.5 and it got all of the questions correct, which isn't surprising. I was unable to test GPT against the "Assembling Objects" since it no longer accepts image uploads from free users, but it would be cool to find out how it would answer a question like this:

![asvab]


I wonder if it reads the features in an image and then converts it into prompt that it feeds itself. My prompting skills are severely lacking, but my letter prompt explores this premise:

![problem]

OpenAI's marketing video for the image feature suggests that something like this is possible for chatGPT, especially with the added context of the multiple choice options.
